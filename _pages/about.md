I am a postdoctoral researcher in network science and the Science of Success at the Barabasi Lab. My research is interdisciplinary in nature, and is primarily focused on social networks. I have also carried out work related to  public health, blockchain,  infrastructure networks, viral dynamics, financial networks, and other areas.

Background
------
I completed my undergraduate degree at Northwestern University in Physics and Integrated Science in 2013. I then moved to Israel to do a Ph.D. at Bar-Ilan University under [Prof. Shlomo Havlin](http://havlin.biu.ac.il), which I was awarded in 2020. Since  Sep. 2019 I have been with Prof. [Albert-Laszlo Barabasi](http://barabasilab.com) at Northeastern University carrying out postdoctoral research.
