This image appears in the paper "Critical field-exponents for secure message-passing in modular networks". The network here shows a network with community structure where each community is equally controlled primarily by 2 main parties equally e.g., the left network is primarily controlled by green and purple. At the same time, there are some nodes controlled by the other parties e.g., in the left network there are a few red and blue nodes each.
